State:

- No type checking. No checking at all, really.

Implemented:

- Expression (variables, constants, plus, equal, less than) for 64 bit integers
- Local variables, assignment, `if`, `while`, `return`

Must have, in some form:

- procedures-calls
- arrays
- type checking


Really, really want:
- proper tail calls

Random bunch of words:
- named disjoint sums, named products
- area allocation
- green threads, fibres, async
- (simple) lambdas
- closures
